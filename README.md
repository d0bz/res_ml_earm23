# Welcome to machine learning project!

This project is for Taltech studies in renewable energy resources institute. Those scripts are to calculate prosumer profits and effectiveness using solar energy, storing to battery and using energy for electric water heater.
Inspect files and see what is needed to run scripts. Initial data can be requested directly


# Files
**prepare_data.py** - this is meant for the data prepration using Elerings electricity information and also inverter + electric water heater data

**calculate_predictions.py** - run machine learning regression model
**calculate_statistics.py** - gives overview of PV generated energy and profits compared with using from grid
